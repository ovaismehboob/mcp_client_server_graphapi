## 🚀 Ready for GitHub

Your repository is now safe to push to GitHub! The cleanup script has verified:

1. **No sensitive credentials** are present in tracked files
2. **Build artifacts** have been removed
3. **Temporary files** have been cleaned up
4. **Configuration templates** are properly set up with placeholders

## 📝 Next Steps for New Developers

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Follow CONFIGURATION.md** to set up local credentials
3. **Run the application** with their own Azure AD and OpenAI settings
4. **Use clean-for-github.ps1** before any commits

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- Original credentials have been completely removed
- All sensitive data is now in placeholder format
- The .gitignore prevents accidental credential commits
- Local development can use separate config files that won't be committed

**Status: ✅ SAFE FOR GITHUB PUSH**
